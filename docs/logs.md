: In our next iteration of the LLM component (and certainly in pipeline_v1.py), we will increase this value significantly. Let's aim for n_ctx=8192 as a next step and monitor memory usage. The trade-off is simple: larger n_ctx = better conversational memory = higher RAM consumption. We need to find the sweet spot.

The Real-Time Factor (RTF) is 3.16s / 2.0s â‰ˆ 1.58.
An RTF > 1.0 means the model takes longer to process the audio than the audio's actual duration.
This means large-v3, with these settings, cannot operate in a simple, real-time streaming fashion. If a user speaks for 10 seconds, it will take over 15 seconds to get the transcription, by which point any feeling of "real-time" conversation is completely lost.

Strategic Implications & Next Steps
This latency issue does not mean large-v3 is unusable. It means our architecture must be intelligent enough to manage this latency. We have several strategic paths forward, and a truly inventive system will likely blend them:
"Two-Speed" STT System (The Most Likely Path):
Phase A (Real-time, Low-Latency): Use a much smaller, faster model (like base.en or tiny.en, which will have an RTF << 1.0) for the initial transcription. This model's job is to provide an immediate, "good enough" transcript to the LLM so it can start thinking and generating a response instantly.
Phase B (High-Accuracy, Background): In parallel, the full 10-second audio chunk is sent to our powerful large-v3 model. When it finishes processing (e.g., 15 seconds later), it produces a "perfect" transcript.
Orchestrator's Role: The Orchestrator can then use this corrected transcript to refine the conversation, update its internal state, or even issue a correction if the initial LLM response was based on a significant error from the tiny model. This mimics how humans sometimes mishear something and then correct themselves a moment later.
Optimizing large-v3:
We can investigate quantization. A 4-bit quantized version of large-v3 might bring the RTF closer to 1.0.
We can explore speculative decoding or other advanced inference techniques specifically for Whisper.
Accepting the "Press-to-Talk" Paradigm:
We could decide that for maximum quality, the user must speak and then wait, similar to a walkie-talkie. This is a simpler architecture but a less magical user experience. Our goal is conversational, so this is a fallback.

# Phase0
LLM (llama.cpp): We confirmed we can get massive GPU acceleration for our core cognitive engine, with an inference speed (~65 t/s) far exceeding what's needed for real-time speech. We identified n_ctx as a key parameter for conversational memory.
STT (mlx-whisper): We validated our ability to run a state-of-the-art STT model (large-v3) locally. We extracted critical word-level timestamps and, most importantly, identified a key architectural challenge: its latency (RTF > 1.0) requires an intelligent, non-linear pipeline design.
TTS (mlx-audio): We validated a lightweight, extremely high-performance TTS model (Kokoro) with a phenomenal RTF (< 0.2). This confirms that the speech generation part of our pipeline will be exceptionally fast and responsive.
