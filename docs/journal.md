**Topic:** Phase 1 Completion: The Traceable "Dumb Pipe" - Performance Baseline
**Status:** Completed

**1. Context:**
The objective of Phase 1 was to construct a complete, synchronous, end-to-end voice pipeline (`Audio In -> STT -> LLM -> TTS -> Audio Out`) to validate the integration of our core components and establish a baseline for total system latency. The pipeline was instrumented with `loguru` for detailed observability.

**2. Execution & Key Metrics:**
The `pipeline_v1.py` script was executed with a 4-second audio input ("Hello can you hear me?"). The following latencies were logged for each leg of the pipeline:

*   **Audio Recording:** 4.16s (as expected)
*   **STT (`whisper-large-v3`):** 2.60s
*   **LLM (`Qwen3-4B-Q4`):** 0.38s
*   **TTS (`Kokoro-82M`):** 3.11s
*   **Audio Playback:** 5.69s (duration of the output audio)
*   **Total End-to-End Latency:** **16.51 seconds**

**3. Architectural Analysis & Key Findings:**

*   **The Golden Metric:** The total latency from the start of recording to the end of playback for this single turn was **16.51 seconds**. This is our scientific baseline. The goal of Phase 2 is to architect a system that dramatically reduces the *perceived* latency, even if the total computation time remains similar.

*   **Latency Breakdown (The "User Wait Time"):** The critical period for the user is the "dead air" between when they stop speaking and when the agent starts replying.
    *   `User Stops Speaking (at ~4.16s)`
    *   `STT Processing Time: 2.60s`
    *   `LLM Processing Time: 0.38s`
    *   `TTS Processing Time: 3.11s`
    *   **Total "Dead Air" Latency:** `2.60 + 0.38 + 3.11 = **6.09 seconds**`

    This **6.09 seconds** of silence is the primary antagonist we must defeat. It is far too long for a natural conversation.

*   **TTS Latency Anomaly:** The TTS synthesis time (3.11s) is significantly higher than our Phase 0 test (~0.85s).
    *   **Hypothesis:** The `generate_audio` function is re-loading the Kokoro model and its pipeline on every call, just like the LLM was in our previous test. This `~2s` of extra time is likely model loading, not pure synthesis. This confirms our hypothesis that a persistent, server-like architecture where models are loaded once is non-negotiable.

*   **LLM is NOT the Bottleneck:** The LLM inference is blazingly fast (0.38s). Our choice of a quantized 4B model on the M4 GPU is validated as an excellent performance decision. The "thinking" is not the slow part.

*   **STT is a Major Contributor:** At 2.60s, the STT is a significant chunk of the dead air. While its RTF is good, in a synchronous chain, its absolute time cost is high.

*   **Phonemizer Warning:** The `WARNING:phonemizer:words count mismatch` is noted. This is an internal warning from the TTS backend, likely due to its handling of the emoji (`ðŸ˜Š`). While not a critical error, it points to a lack of robustness in the text-cleaning pre-processor for the TTS, which we may need to address later.

**4. Conclusion & Transition to Phase 2:**
Phase 1 is a complete success. We have a working, fully local, end-to-end pipeline. We have validated all component interfaces and, most importantly, used our observability framework to precisely measure our performance baseline and identify the primary architectural challenges.

The "Dumb Pipe" architecture's **6.09 seconds of dead air** is unacceptable for a conversational agent. This result gives us a clear mandate for Phase 2.

### **The Path to Phase 2: From Synchronous Pipe to Asynchronous Brain**

The problem is clear: the sequential `STT -> LLM -> TTS` chain creates a long, silent wait for the user. The solution is to **parallelize** this process.

**Our Core Objective for Phase 2:**
*To have the TTS engine start speaking the beginning of the LLM's response *while the LLM is still generating the rest of it*. This will crush the perceived latency.*

This requires a complete architectural shift from a linear script to an asynchronous, event-driven system.

Here is the updated roadmap:



**Entry: 2024-05-23**
**Topic:** Selection and Validation of the Initial TTS Engine
**Status:** Decision Made

**1. Context:**
To complete Phase 0, we needed to select and validate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine that could run locally on the M4 Mac via the MLX framework. The primary requirements were performance (low RTF for streaming potential) and quality.

**2. Exploration & Alternatives:**
*   **Alternative 1: XTTS-v2.** A high-quality model, but initial investigation suggested a more complex API and potentially higher computational cost.
*   **Alternative 2: Kokoro-82M.** A smaller, more modern model specifically available in the `mlx-community`. The documentation trail was complex, leading us from manual implementation attempts to the discovery of the `mlx-audio` library.
*   **Experiment:** We ran the `test_tts.py` script against the local Kokoro model.
*   **Key Result:** The engine's verbose output reported a **Real-time Factor (RTF) of 0.12x**, meaning it can synthesize audio ~8.3 times faster than real-time. Peak memory was a reasonable 2.23GB.

**3. Decision & Rationale:**
We have selected **Kokoro-82M**, executed via the `mlx-audio` library, as our baseline TTS engine.
*   **Rationale:** The exceptionally low RTF directly serves our Guiding Principle of "Minimize Perceived Latency." Its availability as a well-supported MLX community model ensures maintainability. The quality is sufficient for our initial pipeline, and its low resource footprint leaves performance budget for other components.

**4. Next Steps & Implications:**
*   We will integrate the `mlx_audio.tts.generate` function into our `pipeline_v1.py` script.
*   The function's side-effect nature (saving a file instead of returning a waveform) will need to be managed in the pipeline's control flow.

**Entry: 2024-05-23**
**Topic:** Analyzing LLM Leg Performance & Caching Behavior
**Status:** Decision Made

**1. Context:**
We integrated the `Qwen3-4B` LLM into `pipeline_v1.py`. The pipeline executed successfully, but analysis of the log output revealed two significant architectural issues:
    1.  The LLM model loading time was incurred on every single run, indicating a failure in our caching strategy.
    2.  `llama.cpp` issued a warning about underutilizing the model's context window.

**2. Exploration & Root Cause Analysis:**

*   **Issue 1: Caching Failure.**
    *   **Observation:** The log shows `LLM loaded successfully in 1.27s` on every execution.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `LLMEngine` class is instantiated inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This means the model is loaded, used, and then the entire object is destroyed when the script finishes. The Python process terminates, and all memory is released. My previous caching assumption was flawed because it only applied to function calls *within the same, single script execution*, not across multiple executions.
    *   **Architectural Implication:** For a real voice agent, this is a fatal flaw. The agent must be a long-running, persistent process (a "server" or "daemon"). It cannot afford to pay the multi-second model loading penalty for every single conversational turn. Our current script acts like a "one-shot" command, not a persistent agent.

*   **Issue 2: Context Window (`n_ctx`).**
    *   **Observation:** Log shows `llama_context: n_ctx_per_seq (4096) < n_ctx_train (262144)`.
    *   **Root Cause:** We hard-coded `n_ctx=4096`, which is significantly smaller than the model's massive native context.
    *   **Architectural Implication:** This is a critical limitation for a conversational agent. While 4096 tokens are sufficient for a single turn, it severely limits the agent's ability to remember previous parts of the conversation. Given the M4's Unified Memory, we are leaving a massive amount of the hardware's potential on the table. We should increase this to a much larger value to support true multi-turn conversational memory.

**3. Decision & Solution:**

*   **For Caching:** We will not "fix" this in the `pipeline_v1.py` script itself. Instead, we will formally acknowledge that the **architecture of a real agent requires a persistent process**. The `pipeline_v1.py` script is a *simulation* of a single turn within such a process. When we move to Phase 2 (Asynchronous Streaming), we will refactor the entire application into a server-like structure where the models are loaded *once* into memory at startup. For now, we accept the reload on each run as a known limitation of our current "single-turn simulation" script.

*   **For Context Window:** We will **immediately increase the `n_ctx` value** in our `LLMEngine` class. Let's choose a more substantial value, like `32768` (32k), as a new baseline. This is a simple change that dramatically increases the potential capability of our agent. We will monitor the memory impact.

**4. Next Steps & Implementation:**
*   Update the `n_ctx` parameter in `pipeline_v1.py`.
*   Proceed to the final leg of the Phase 1 pipeline, the TTS integration.

### **Performance Review of the LLM Leg**

Let's also quickly analyze the excellent performance numbers:
*   **LLM Load Time:** 1.27s. Very fast for a 4B model.
*   **LLM Inference Time:** 0.38s. Extremely fast.
*   **Transcription Time:** 1.11s. Slower than the 0.57s in the previous test. This is expected variance; audio content, length, and system load can affect it. It's still well within our performance budget.

The total "time to think" (STT + LLM) was `1.11s + 0.38s = 1.49s`. This is our core latency for the synchronous "brain" of the operation. This is the number we will aim to reduce in Phase 2, not by making the models faster, but by running them in parallel.
